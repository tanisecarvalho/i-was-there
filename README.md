## User Experience (UX)

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The palette was defined using [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/palette/2d033b810ca8c147e9e5b8f4). I knew I wanted to use purple and black as the two main colours.

When I searched on the website for palettes with both colours, this one got my attention straightway.

- #2D033B
- #810CA8
- #C147E9
- #E5B8F4

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to select and import the fonts on this project.

For the logo and headings, the font is Quicksand.

![Quicksand Bold](docs/quicksand_2.JPG)

For the body and forms, the font is Oxygen.

### Imagery

The logo was created using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). The idea came from mixing a pin location map and musical notes.

#### How to Fork

  1. Log In or Sign Up to GitHub.
  2. Go to this project repository [https://github.com/tanisecarvalho/i-was-there](https://github.com/tanisecarvalho/i-was-there)
  2. On the top right of the page, there's a button with the option Fork. Click on it.
  3. A new page, "Create a new fork", will open. If you wish, you can edit the name.
  4. At the end of the page, click on "Create fork".
  5. Now, you have a copy of the project in your repositories.

#### How to Clone

  1. Log In or Sign Up to GitHub.
  2. Go to this project repository [https://github.com/tanisecarvalho/i-was-there](https://github.com/tanisecarvalho/i-was-there)
  3. Click on the Code button and select if you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link.
  4. Open the terminal in the code editor of your choice and change the current working directory to the one you will use for to clone the repository.
  5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied before and press Enter.

#### Using Gitpod
If you would like to edit your copy of this repository on Gitpod, you will need to: 
  1. On your browser of choice, install the Gitpod extension/add-on.
  2. On GitHub, open the project repository you forked before.
  3. On the top of the page, over the files, there is a green button on the right side of the page saying "Gitpod". Click it.
  4. It will open the Gitpod website. On the first time, you will select to connect with your GitHub account and Authorize gitpod-io. After that, you'll create an account.
  5. It might take a while after that because Gitpod will create your workspace.
  After the workspace is loaded, you can edit it on Gitpod.
